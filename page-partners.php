			<p>ARTnude Philly's donations will be going towards the <em>Abramson Cancer Center Patient Special Needs Fund</em>, which supports cancer patients and families who are in financial need as a result of their diagnosis and treatment. The nurse navigators and social workers use this fund to help pay for necessities such as parking and taxi vouchers, septa tokens, medications not covered by insurance, meals for families accompanying patients to treatment, popsicles for patients to have during chemotherapy, household bills and other living expenses. Donations from ARTnude Philly would help increase the funds available to meet the demand of these patients and families, and provide larger awards to those who are in need of financial assistance.</p>
