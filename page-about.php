			<h2>Debuting in 2012, ARTnude Philly is a city-wide, two week benefit show to raise cancer awareness. Over 40% of all the proceeds will be donated directly to the <a href="">Abramson Cancer Center</a> in Philadelphia, with the other 60% of proceeds benefitting local artists. The show will run from October 19th to November 2nd, with an opening reception at the <a href="">James Oliver Gallery</a>. The reception will be on October 19th at 7 PM.</h2>

					<p>Our photo shoot features color-blocking designs painted onto nude models. These models are all volunteers who just want to contribute to the show, and some of them are also patients from the Abramson Cancer Center. Each color they are painted with represents an official cancer color with layers and patterns that are representations of that aesthetic. ARTnude Philly has one objective: Contemporary Art for Cancer Awareness. The "nude" in ARTnude Philly does not specifically relate to the nude figure but rather unveils the transparency of cancer awareness and contemporary art. The show welcomes all kinds of artwork submissions and contributions. We are excited to present a show with engaging, contemporary work. </p>
